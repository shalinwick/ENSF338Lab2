Interpolation search can provide an advantage over binary search in scenarios that meet specific criteria.

a. Better performance with unorganized data

Interpolation search uses aspects of data distribution by making educated guesses about the location of a specific element. It utilizes a formula to predict where the target may be, which can be advantageous when data is non-uniform. On the contrary, binary search splits the search space by half at each step, whch relies on the fact that the data is already distributed in an organized manner which wouldn't be as efficient.

b. Quicker convergence on sorted and continous data

In circumtances where data is sorted and continous, interpolation search typically performs better than binary search. This is due to interpolation search's process of adapting its search space based on the predicted position of the target. This potentially reduces the number of iterations required to eventually locate the target element as opposed to binary search.

Interpolation search runs on the pretense that data is distributed uniformly to make intelligent guesses about the position of the target element. When data is arranged in an unsorted manner, performance of interpolation search can be impacted negatively.

a. Estimation accuracy

Interpolation search calculates the likely position of the target using information about the distribution of the data itself. If the data follows an unsorted pattern, the formula utilized by interpolation search may be inaccurate when estimated the targets location. This may result in the algorithms search space skipping over areas of data where the target element may potentially contain the targets position, or converging in the wrong direction entirely. 

b. Uneven data distribution

In data with uneven distribution, the pretenses and assumptions made by interpolation search may not hold true. The interpolation formula may then inefficiently guide the search process to find the target element, which lowers performance where binary search may have been a better solution.

c. Over/underestimation

The interpolation formula operates under the pretense of linear relationship between positions and values being searched. If the organization of data heavily differs from a linear format, the estimates concluded by the formula may over or underestimate the true position of the target element.

To modify interpolation search method to follow a different distribution, the primary factor to alter would be the interpolation formula used to estimate the position of the target element within the allocated search space. For default interpolation search, the formula assumes linear relationship between positions and values being searched. To adapt to another distribution, the formula would need to be changed to better reflect the aspects of data distribution in question. This could perhaps involve the use of a different mathematical function that is better suited for the particular set of data. For example, if a set of data follows a logarithmic distribution, a logarithmic interpolation formula would likely provide a compact solution. Same thing would go for a set of data that follows an exponential pattern. Ultimately, the key part is the modify the process the algorithm usess to estimated the position of the target element based on the characteristics of the particular set of data you are working with.

Linear sarch can be the only option under certain circumstances.

a. Data is unsorted

Linear search can prove effective when data is unsorted. In contrast, binary and interpolation search rely on data being arranged in an organized manner (ascending or descending order). In the case of unsorted data, both binary and interpolation search may provide inaccurate results.

b. Uknown data distribution

Linear search doesn't operate under any pretenses about the dataset. It functions sequentially and scans the entire dataset one by one until the target element is found or the end of the data is reached. For scenarios where data distribution is known or follows a very irregular pattern, linear serch might be the only option available.

Linear search can potentially outperform both binary and interpolation search in certain cases as well.

a. Dataset size is small

When the dataset is somewhat small, linear search can be more effective in comparison to the other two search methods. This is due to the time complexity O(n) of linear search. In the case of small datasets, the sorting process of interpolation and binary search involve more calculations/complexity to estimate target position, which would be unncessary.

b. Target element is near the beginning

If the target elements location is near the beggning of the dataset, linear search can find it faster than both other search methods. Due to the sequential nature of linear search, this case would result in the search method finding the target location instantly. Binary and interpolation sarch would traverse much more of the dataset before potentially landing on the targets true position, in turn consuming more time.

c. Data has unsorted/random order

Linear search operates sequentially, and thus does not rely on the fact that data is sorted using a specific pattern such as ascending or descending order. If data is unsorted or random, linear search still does not have trouble checking each element one by one until the target element is found. The other two search methods require the data to be sorted, which would make linear search a much more efficient and straightforward method in this scenario.

There are some ways to improve binary and interpolation search algorithms to address the limitations discussed earlier.

Developing techniques to handle unsorted data that use these two search algorithms can prove to be
