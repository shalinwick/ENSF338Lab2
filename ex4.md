When you see the sign at the entrance, check if it shows the numbers of the rooms nearby. If it includes the number you're looking for (EY128), which it does since it shows EY 100-130, turn left. Then, just keep going down the hallway, looking at each room number until you find EY128.

2.
A "step" here means moving from one room to the next along the hallway. Since EY128 is on the left side, you'd take 14 steps to get there from the entrance, passing each left-side room on the way.

3.
It's not the best or worst case. In the best case, you'd find EY128 right away. In the worst case, it would be the last room, and you'd have to check every other room first.

4.
Best-case: Finding EY128 immediately after turning left.
Worst-case: EY128 being at the end of the hallway after checking every other room on the left.

5.
If you remember where EY128 is in relation to the entrance, you don't have to check every room. You can just walk straight there.
